                    Mahjong Mazaa was born from a simple realization: mahjong is a game that knows how to find its way home, no matter whose table it lands on. From Chinese teahouses to Jewish living rooms to South Asian gatherings—this game has always been about community, strategy, and the ritual of coming together.

                        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                            Mahjong Mazaa is a tile set designed with South Asian aesthetics—warm colors, culturally resonant patterns, and an invitation to gather. But we're not reinventing the game. The tiles are still Dots, Bams, and Cracks. The rules are still the rules. The strategy is still the strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                            What's different is the feeling. These tiles feel at home on South Asian tables. They belong alongside chai or coffee, amidst multigenerational conversations, in spaces where hospitality isn't just offered—it's woven into the fabric of gathering.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8;">
                            We're not claiming mahjong as "ours." We're creating tiles that let South Asian communities feel seen, welcomed, and invited to participate in a tradition that has always crossed cultural boundaries.

                            We're not taking mahjong, renaming it, and pretending it's South Asian. We honor its Chinese origins explicitly. We name its complicated American history honestly. And we position ourselves as hosts, not owners.

                            We're not "modernizing" or "improving" mahjong. This game doesn't need fixing. It's been played and beloved for over 150 years. We're simply offering an aesthetic that feels resonant to a new community.

                            We don't skip over the racism of the 1920s American fad. We don't gloss over Orientalist marketing. We don't minimize the identity-building work of Jewish women in the 1930s-50s. All of this matters.

                            These tiles aren't "only for South Asians." They're for anyone who appreciates the aesthetic, the cultural care, and the invitation to gather. Mahjong has always been a game that welcomes.

                        <h3 style="color: var(--chai-gold); margin-bottom: 15px;">1. We Honor Origins</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8;">
                            Mahjong was born in Southern China in the mid-1800s. That's where this story begins, and we never let anyone forget it. Every tile set includes the full history—not sanitized, not simplified, but told with care and respect.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 style="color: var(--chai-gold); margin-bottom: 15px;">2. We Acknowledge Complexity</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8;">
                            The 1920s American mahjong fad was steeped in racism and Orientalism. Jewish women in the 1930s created powerful community through the game while navigating their own experiences of marginalization. These aren't footnotes—they're essential parts of the story.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 style="color: var(--chai-gold); margin-bottom: 15px;">3. We Welcome Through Resonance</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8;">
                            South Asian communities deserve to see themselves reflected in the games they play—not through appropriation, but through thoughtful design that invites them to the table. Cultural resonance isn't ownership; it's hospitality.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 30px; background-color: white;">
                        <h3 style="color: var(--chai-gold); margin-bottom: 15px;">4. We Stay Humble</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8;">
                            When we make mistakes (and we will), we listen, we learn, and we correct course. This is delicate work. Cultural bridge-building requires constant care, humility, and willingness to be accountable to the communities we serve and honor.

                                Mahjong emerges in Southern China toward the end of the Qing Dynasty. It likely evolved from earlier card games. The name "mahjong" (麻將/麻雀) means "sparrow" in southern Chinese dialects.

                                Joseph Park Babcock brought mahjong to the United States. The game became an enormous fad, but the story was complicated by racism and Orientalism. Marketers falsely claimed mahjong was thousands of years old.
